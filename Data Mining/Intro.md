# Introduction: Data Mining

Data Mining
: A cross-disciplinary field focused on discovering patterns of (large, very large) data sets.
- Machine learning is one approach.

# Attributes
## Random variables
- A random Variable, X, is a variable whose possible values are drawn from the outcome of a random phenomenon.
- Types:
  -   Discrete
  -   Continous
- Population vs Sample
  - All we have is the sample, from which we will derive the distribution and moments, which are close to the population distribution and moments.
  - The model that well describes populations is a better model.

## Measures of central tendency
- Mean
  - The average. It is the sum of a collection of numbers divided by the count of numbers in the collection.
  - Robustness: Mean is not robust (unstable). A robust measure is trimmed mean, which occurs after extreme values on either side are discarded.
- Median
  - The central value of the data collection. 
    - If the number of data n is odd -> median value is the number that is in the middel with the same amount of numbers below and above. 
    - if the number of data n is even -> median value is the mean value of the middel pair (add 2 vlaues and devided by 2).
  - the median value is the number that is in the middle, with the same amount of numbers below and above.
  - Robustness: Median is robust (stable). Median is not affected by extreme values (outliers).
